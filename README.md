# Team Role Generator 
  The main purpose of this project was to create a Role Generator to create and maintain a roster of employees and display them as cards using bootstrap. It dynamically creates a HTML dynamically using NodeJS, Inquirer and fs, based on the input from the user. This was a great project and furthered my knowledge on  Node and how to use Inquirer prompts and questions, I look forward for my future projects that may have a similar functionality.
