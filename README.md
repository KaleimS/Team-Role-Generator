# Team Role Generator 
  The main objective of this project was to develop a Role Generator that could create and manage a list of employees and display them as cards using Bootstrap. It uses NodeJS, Inquirer, and fs to dynamically create an HTML page based on the user's input. This project helped me improve my knowledge of Node and how to use Inquirer prompts and questions.
I'm looking forward to working on similar projects that have the same functionality in the future.
